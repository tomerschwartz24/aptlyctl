# aptlyctl
aptly is an apt repository manager, it is quite a small project which gained a fair amount of user-base but is lacking in terms of CLI.

# Motivation
The need for this project has arised due to the fact that the existing aptly CLI projects are not maintained for many years and aren't documented properly.


## Pyinstaller
This project uses pyinstaller in order to build and distribute this CLI easily with no hassle and CI in mind.
